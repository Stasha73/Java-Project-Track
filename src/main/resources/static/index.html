I want to create a travel guide/blog for the solo traveler.
I want to create a resource for women specifically who love to travel,
but have concerns about where to go. The website would allow you to set up
a profile where you can post recommendations and provide helpful travel tips.
The post section would include data consisting of titles, ratings and (posts).
Using keywords, I want to be able to sort by title, rating or location.
